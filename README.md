# classification-challenge
The two classification models (linear regression, and random forest) to see which one predicts/classifies spam emails better. After splitting the data into training and testing datasets, scaling the data, and then initializing, fitting, predicting, and scoring using each model, I was able to determine that the random forest model (96.7% accuracy) outperformed the linear regression model (92.9% accuracy). Both models did better than my initial prediction, however the results did support my hypothesis that the random forest model would be a somewhat significantly better model in this siituation.
